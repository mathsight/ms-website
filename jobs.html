    	At MathSight, we apply new technology and clever techniques to advise
    	clients in their quest to perform search engine optimisation (SEO). We
    	deal with large amounts of data that is periodically gathered, en masse,
    	from our clientsâ€™ websites and various web-based APIs. With this data we
    	are building a suite of processing applications that will revolutionise
    	the way SEO is done.
    	<div>
    		<br>
    	</div>
    	<div>
    		These applications will deploy machine-learning techniques in order to
    		enhance and scale up our resident (human) SEO expertise. As an intern ,
    		you will provide the team with a core programming skill set and entrepreneurial
    		flair to help us to build a fundamental link in the chain; the leap from
    		prototype to working, presentable and scalable application. This will enable
    		our start-up company to tend to an increasing number of clients and with
    		far more accuracy in the area of site optimisation.
    	</div>
    	<div>
    		<br>
    	</div>
    	<div>
    		The data generated by our current prototype software is stored in the
    		cloud, and the sheer amount of this information is increasing rapidly as
    		we acquire new beta-testing clients, and add new features to the datasets.
    		It is used to feed into statistical algorithms; either as a dataset for
    		unsupervised learning techniques, or to provide training and test datasets
    		for supervised regression and classification algorithms.
    	</div>
    	<div>
    		<br>
    	</div>
    	<div>
    		As a technical intern your job will be of relatively high responsibility
    		and encompass a wide-range of tasks, given that this is a small start-up.
    		You will work with our java developer and the chief systems architect and
    		ensure that prototype back-end analytical algorithms are transferred into
    		Python and /or Java and will eventually feed into JavaScript, CSS and HTML
    		as part of a slick, customer-facing web interface and API.
    	</div>
    	<div>
    		<br>
    	</div>
    	<div>
    		We would like to emphasise that this is not a straightforward developer
    		role; rather it will involve a broader skillset with design of algorithms,
    		creative ability and a view to create an extremely well presented product.
